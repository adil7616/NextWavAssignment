# NextWavAssignment
this is an assignment for selection process
The assignment consists of two parts: 
Part 1: 
You are required to prepare a pattern-printing coding question. For this, you should provide 
solutions in three programming languages: C++, Python, and Java. 
Question: 
Given a number N, print a layered numeric square pattern of size (2N - 1) x (2N - 1) that 
creates a square matrix with decreasing layers from outermost to center.  
Input: N = 4  
Output: 

4 4 4 4 4 4 4 

4 3 3 3 3 3 4 

4 3 2 2 2 3 4 

4 3 2 1 2 3 4 

4 3 2 2 2 3 4 

4 3 3 3 3 3 4 

4 4 4 4 4 4 4 



Part 2: 
You need to come up with a new graph question, following the same structure as in Part 1, and 
provide solutions in C++, Python, and Java. 

Input: 
 
V=4, E= 4  

: 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 0 -> 2 -> 3 

output:” yes ” 
	0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0
